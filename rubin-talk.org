#+TITLE: A Brief Overview of the Rubin Observatory

* A Brief Overview of the Rubin Observatory

Almost everything I am going to tell you can be found in the [[https://www.lsst.org/sites/default/files/docs/sciencebook/SB_Whole.pdf][Science
Book]].  It's quite dry and a little out of date, but it is the
definitive reference for the general scientific community.

The [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/0805.2366.pdf][LSST Overview Paper]] is a good--but still dense--summary of the
Science Book.

** What is the Rubin Observatory?

It is the observatory that will carry out the Legacy Survey Of Space And
Time.

It was formerly known as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST).
The name was changed in late 2019 to honor [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vera_Rubin][Vera Rubin]].

Rubin performed the first rigorous quantitative work proving that
galaxies could not behave as they did if the mass was where the light
was, giving firm experimental confirmation of Zwicky's "Dark Matter,"
hypothesized in 1933.

Since understanding dark matter and dark energy is among the primary
purposes of the survey, the renaming of the observatory in her honor was
particularly fitting.

*** New Nomenclature

Most of what you will find on the Web still talks about "LSST".  This
will change over time, and we have adopted a more precise set of names
for observatory components.

The Observatory as a whole is the "Vera C. Rubin Observatory"; "Rubin
Observatory" for short.

The ten-year survey is the "LSST".

The telescope is the "Simonyi Survey Telescope".

Rubin Observatory is funded by NSF, DOE, and many public and private
donors.

/Please do not call it "VRO".  Use "Rubin Observatory" instead./

** Where is it?

It's in the Andes foothills, about an hour from La Serena, Chile (57
km), on Cerro Pachón.  It is at approximately 2680m elevation.

*** Why there?

This location is excellent for optical astronomy (including infrared)
for several reasons:

*** It's in the Atacama Desert, which is extremely dry

8800 feet is much easier for humans to work at than 14,000 (Mauna Kea)
but you're still above almost all the water vapor in the air.  Expected
mean seeing is 0.67" (remember this when we talk about the camera).

*** Long partnership between United States and Chilean astronomy

First joint observatories were built in the 1960s.

(There was also a lot of Cold War politics involved.)

*** Lots of existing infrastructure

Gemini South and SOAR are also on Cerro Pachón; it's 10 km from Cerro
Tololo (CTIO).  So we had power, comms, and a road to the mountain
already.

** What is the Rubin Observatory's purpose?

The first (and currently the only) mission of the Rubin Observatory is
to execute the Legacy Survey Of Space And Time (LSST).

** Legacy Survey of Space and Time

The LSST is a ten-year survey of the southern sky.  Six bands, from
near-ultraviolet to near-infrared (320-1080nm).  We will get a complete
picture of the Southern sky (in at least one band) every three nights
(-ish, dependent on survey cadence).  This will enable detection of
faint transient phenomena with a much greater degree of completeness
than ever before.

*** How do we do that?

We will make approximately 1000 visits a night, and take a picture of
the sky with a 30-second exposure time.  Each picture is 3.2 gigapixels.
Then we slew the telescope and do it again, all night, every night, for
ten years, weather (and other factors) permitting.

*** When will we do that?

COVID-19 affected our schedule, so timing is somewhat uncertain.  We are
in the process of re-baselining the project with our funding agencies,
and currently we expect to begin science operations on October 1, 2023.

It's not just the days lost because the Chilean government has closed
the road to the summit, or La Serena is in quarantine, or no non-Chilean
staff can travel to the country let alone the site, but also
second-order effects such as "and then the observatory sat without a
roof for an extra winter," and of course there are many components that
can't be worked on until the dome is closed.

** Data Volume

We will collect 20-ishTB of pipeline-processed data a night.  That's
equivalent to all the data collected over the Hubble Space Telescope's
30+-year lifetime /each week/.

We will take over one trillion photometric measurements of astronomical
sources.

The reduced catalogue (the primary science product) will be on the order
of 15PB: tens of billions of rows, with complex structure, in a
database.

The complete data set (with cailbrated exposures, templates, etc.) will
approach half an exabyte.

** The Symonyi Survey Telescope

The telescope is distinguished by several characteristics, imposed by
the requirements of the survey.  Chief among these are its compactness
and its rigidity, which are necessary to be able to quickly and
accurately repoint the telescope a thousand times a night and take a
picture without the telescope swaying.

*** Physical Characteristics

The telescope will make 1000 thirty-second visits a night, with five
seconds in between each visit to repoint and damp the telescope.

We have to move it from one location on the sky to another and have it
settle in 4.8 seconds for a change of 3.5° elevation and 7° azimuth:
2-ish seconds of motion and 3-ish seconds to settle to 0.1".

In order to be able to move that quickly and settle that fast, the
telescope has to be extremely rigid.  The whole assembly weighs about
450 tons.  The azimuth motors total 400 HP and the elevation motors 50
HP.  The rim of the assembly is moving at about 30 mph when we are
repointing.

*** Telescope optical design

This requires a very compact telescope.  It is a three-mirror design,
where M1 and M3 are part of the same piece of glass.  This is the
largest monolithic piece of glass ever constructed and seems likely to
remain so given that newer telescope designs mostly use ceramic
substrates.

*** Photon path

[[./assets/mirror.gif]]

*** What can it see?

M1M3 is 8.4m diameter.  That can collect a lot of photons.

Huge field of view: 3.5°.  (JWST is 3.2' or so.)  Seven full moons
side-by-side or a CD at arm's length.  If you calculate that out, each
pixel is about 0.6".

Single-visit depth is magnitude 24.7.  Stacked depth (to 5σ detection)
over the survey is magnitude 27.5: 30/400 million times fainter than
naked eye detection.  (The detectors saturate at magnitude 16, and these
magnitudes are in our r-band, which is our deepest.)

It will be the deepest ground-based survey telescope.

*** Étendue

Étendue is the product of field of view and the primary mirror area.
It's "how much light can a telescope collect in a given time?"  The
Simonyi Survey Telescope's étendue is 319 (m°)², more than an order of
magnitude more than any other instrument.  Hence: wide, fast, deep.

collaboration.

(pointing at the Moon would be really dumb, but not as dumb and
dangerous as pointing at the Sun)

*** Camera design

Currently the largest (in pixel count) digital camera ever made.  Made
at SLAC.  About the physical size of a minivan.

3.2 Gpx, in 189 sensors, divided into 21 rafts (plus four wavefront
sensor rafts).  The first full-focal-plane images have just been made
(September 2020): [[https://www.space.com/vera-rubin-observatory-record-breaking-first-photos.html][space.com article]],
[[https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/news/2020-09-08-sensors-world-largest-digital-camera-snap-first-3200-megapixel-images-slac.aspx][Stanford press release]].

374 4K HDTVs to display a complete image.  That'd tile half a basketball
court.  Remember: about 1000 of those images are produced a night.

*** Camera picture

[[./assets/camera.png]]

*** Active (not adaptive) optics

We use active optics to sharpen the picture.  These are a system of
actuators to (on a timescale of about a second) compensate for mirror
deformation caused by temperature fluctuations, wind, et cetera.

We cannot use adaptive optics (much higher frequency, order of 100Hz) to
compensate for atmospheric distortion as many narrow-field telescopes
do, because our field of view is large and the air within the cone of
sight is nowhere near homogeneous.

** Observatory Cost

Total construction cost is about a half-billion (2013) dollars.

Camera: about $165 million.

M1M3: about $25 million.

Operations: about $35 million/year (or a dollar a second).  About
another half-billion over survey lifetime, factoring in commissioning
time.

Grand total, one billion dollars in round numbers.

** What science will we do with the Rubin Observatory?

There are four major pillars of the LSST research program:

+ Comprehensive solar system survey.
+ Milky Way structure and stellar content.  We should observe about 10
  billion stars, mostly within the Milky Way.
+ Transient phenomena at optical wavelengths.  AGNs, SN1Ae, visual
  confirmation of LIGO detections...
+ Dark Energy and Dark Matter.  Only 4% of the mass/energy budget of the
  universe is baryonic matter and EM radiation.  What's the rest of it?

*** Solar System

+ Congressional mandate to detect 90% of PHAs: objects 140m diameter or
  larger by 2028.  The LSST is a major component of that.  140m is a
  regional disaster, not a dinosaur-killer.  We expect to find about
  100,000 Near Earth Asteroids (not all of them PHAs).
+ We also expect to find about 5.5 million Main Belt Asteroids, 280,000
  Jovian Trojans, and 40,000 Trans-Neptunian Objects.
+ "Deep, Fast, and Wide" is ideal for finding faint small solar system
  objects that move up to the order of degrees a night.
+ Interplanetary coronal mass ejection and its interaction with comets.

*** Milky Way

+ Very low mass stars and brown dwarfs in the local neighborhood.
+ Systematic survey of Southern Hemisphere star clusters.
+ Roughly 10 billion main sequence stars mapped in our galaxy out to
  100kpc, and metallicity over the same volume (because 200 million of
  those stars will be near turn-off main sequence).
+ Much better view of clumps and streams within the Galaxy (bulge and
  disk) and its halo.

*** Transient Phenomena

+ Much better characterization of Cepheid variables, enabling more
  precision of the distance ladder.
+ Vastly more SN1Ae than observed before, out to the limits of the
  observable universe.
+ Quieter star-death events than SN1Ae: intermediate-mass collapse
  without remnant ("macronovae"), core-collapse straight to black hole,
  mergers of exotic objects.
+ This is the perfect instrument for optical followup of LIGO events.
  LIGO says "it's over there somewhere"; even without doing a special
  pointing, we have a picture of "over there" (assuming Southern
  Hemisphere) every three days.

*** Dark Matter and Dark Energy

+ We will observe a great many quasars, many of which will be
  gravitationally lensed by intervening galaxies: the six bands make it
  possible to precisely measure the delay between lensed images.  That
  in turn gives us a picture of the mass in the lensing galaxy, which
  tells us where the dark matter is.
+ Weak (statistical) lensing at cosmological scale: galaxies are,
  presumably, oriented randomly with respect to us, with no bias.  So if
  in a (large) region, we see that more appear elliptical in one
  direction than in another, we can infer the existence of a lens, and
  therefore mass, between us and them.
+ The improvements in the distance ladder from lensing and SN1ae can let
  us constrain the Hubble Constant's value (and its evolution over time,
  which is presumed to be a linear function of proper distance) more
  precisely.  That will let us rule out some dark energy theories.
+ And of course if the Hubble Constant is /not/ (statistically) constant
  across the sky at a given proper distance, that's a Nobel for
  /someone/.

*** A few mind-blowing numbers

We should detect 10 to 40 million AGNs (quasars) over the survey
lifetime.

300,000 supernovae per year.  Current rate, across all instruments, is
7000 a year.  One supernova goes off in a Milky Way-sized galaxy every
few dozen years.  One explodes in the observable universe once every
ten seconds.

About 10 billion galaxies, and about 10 billion stars.  So everyone can
have one of each, with plenty to spare.

If I did my math right, the linear distance spanned by a pixel (0.6") at
the limit of the observable universe (comoving distance: 46.1 billion
light years) is about 134,000 light years.  So a Milky Way-sized
structure in the early universe would just about span a pixel in our
detector.  Except that it's really more complicated than that because of
the stretching of spacetime, but you get the idea.

** Who gets to use this?

+ All astronomers affiliated with US or Chilean institutions.  (In
  practice, anyone with such an affiliation.)
+ All astronomers affiliated with institutions that have data rights
  obtained through in-kind contributions (labor, software, et cetera).
+ Their collaborators, so pretty much all professional astronomers who
  have friends; thus, everyone except a few theorists.
+ But two years after initial publication to data rights holders,
  /everyone/.  (Up to four years after collection: it takes one year for
  processing, so if data is collected early 2025, it won't be published
  to data rights holders as part of the catalogue until the end of 2026,
  and won't be released to the general public until the end of 2028.)

** Data availability

There are three categories of "data products" that will come out of the
survey.  Effectively, they are alerts, catalogues, and user generated
products.

*** Prompt Products

Prompt products are alerts: something has changed significantly
relative to its historical brightness or position.  We have to issue
these within 60 seconds of the shutter closing, and they can be consumed
by anyone with data rights.  We've kept this simple: anything that is
present, and wasn't before, or isn't, and was before, with a certainty
of 5σ (that is, p-value of 1 in 3.5 million), done with an
image-subtraction algorithm.

*** Prompt product volume

It's an enormous firehose: on the order of 10 million alerts a night.
(So, statistically, three of those will just be very unlucky noise, not
real events!)  There will therefore be selective brokers
(community-written, not Rubin Observatory-supplied) that filter the
Rubin-provided stream with further processing to determine what class of
event an alert is, and pass selected alerts downstream.  Those will /not/
have sub-minute latency.

*** Data Releases

Data Releases are our annual catalogues.  Each year, we have to
reprocess all the data collected thus far, in order to get our coadded
(stacked) data correct.  This process will take all year.  Once
published, this too is immediately available to people with data rights,
and two years later for the public.

Alerts and Data Releases are, of course, mostly automated, and the
source code for their production will be publicly available.

*** User Generated Products

User generated products are things derived from the first two categories
to support particular science goals.  This is generally "what I'm
writing the paper about" and will usually remain proprietary to the
group producing the research.

** EPO

Education and Public Outreach will be coordinating curricula (from
middle school to college astronomy courses) and organizing citizen
science projects (think Zooniverse).  As someone interested in the
project who is not a professional astronomer, I sympathize with their
aims.

** What's my role in all this?

I work in the Science Quality and Reliability Engineering (SQuaRE) team,
within the Data Management organization of the Rubin Observatory.  My
particular focus is the interactive notebook aspect of the Science
Platform.

I have worked in IT as a system administrator, software developer,
consultant, software engineer, and many other roles, for more than 30
years.
